# TNTWhitelist

A plugin to create a TNT whitelist for your server.

People in the whitelist can place and ignite TNT blocks. People not in the whitelist cannot.

Inspired by some certain annoying people.

## Commands

- `/tntwl` - List the whitelisted players
- `/tntwladd <player>` - Add a player to the whitelist
- `/tntwlremove <player>` - Remove a player from the whitelist. Also known as `/tntwlrm`.

## `whitelist.txt`
Each line should be a UUID for a whitelisted player. You can manually whitelist players.
